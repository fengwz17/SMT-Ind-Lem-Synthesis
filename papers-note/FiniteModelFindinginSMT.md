# Finite Model Finding in SMT

This paper present a novel finite model finding method that reduces these limitations in the case of quantifiers rangeing over free sorts.

## 2 Satisfiability Modulo Multiple Theories

- Our finite model finding method applies to lazy SMT solvers based on the DPLL(T) architecture.
